All the solutions are written in Scala. Reasons for using Scala:
  1. FP rocks.
  2. Only FP language I know.
  3. Didn't want to mess around with python 2.7 (graphlab not available for 3.5)
  4. Good opportunity to learn Scala better.

In case you feel improvements can be made to the quality of code, raise an issue.
For eg. if a piece of code could be written in a more generic manner, or could be optimized.
